OLTP-Online Transactional Process
==================================
In this Transactional data avilable 
In this we are Using DML - Operations
----
Insert
Update
Delete
having less data in OLTP 


OLAP- Online Analysis Process- Data wherehouse
=============================================
We are storing Historical data in one place 
and from there we are analysis is called data where house (OLAP Type database)
In data wherehouse Data is comming from OLTP databases (files,ERP Applications,databases)
Data analysis, for generating reportings

DRL- Data retrie language (Select Query)
In Data wherehouse For analasysis process we are using different types of normalization forms
we can analysis business by using data wherehouse

Normalization
=============
Deviding main data into no.of different tables
In this DML Operations are flxible

De-normalization
================
No.of different (divided data) clubbing into single table
In this Query ferformanance flexeble

Main data -- in dimension tables (customer info
address, phone, location, customer lo etc)

Any data which we cannot taken as a measure and which is having primary data,or master data 
stored as in dimmention tables 

Any transactional type data stored in fact tables (what ever the transactions he do
in 5 years he do different orders,  different rates, deliery dates different dates like etc)
child data/transactional data- fact table

Types of dimension tables
=====================

1)junk dimension
=====================
Transactional data having millions of records
if we have millions of records in a fact table, in that some columns having low cardinality value
means below type of status fields
active/inactive
male/female
0/1
yes/no
delivered/shipped/undelivered/not delivered
process/pending/completed

low cardinalaty value means flag related columns getting performance issue when we are taking reports
we are removing low cardinality field and creating new table 
that type of value related columens we are stored in junk dimenstion tables.
by using these type of tables performanance will increase 
no measured data, just flag type data avilable


2)conformed dimension
====================

In a wherehouse we are having multiple data marts (sales,Hr,customers)data

when common dimention table used in multiple models 

tv company
==========
sales tabel- tv sales

if any table which is using more than one dimenstion model or more than one data mart is called a
conformed dimention table
inventory table
sales table
maufacturing

degenerate dimension
===================
header and lines tables

orders header --- parent table/fact table
order line --- child table/transactional table/ to quantity/price
shipment header
shipment line
sales header
sales line
invioce header
invoice line
order header is pare

it is not a fact table or it is not a fully dimension table but we can treate as a dimension table

Inferred dimension--late arrival dimmension
===================================
Dimension table ---parent
fact table --- child
fact-- dim_id (key) -1 //(dimension_id or surrogate key) inserted as -1 in fact table
when the 

in some sinarios we are having fact table information and not having some info dimension table

by using some script we are updating dimention table after fact table key information comming
